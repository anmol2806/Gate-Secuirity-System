As thefts are increasing day by day security is becoming a major concern nowadays. <br>In this project , there are two switches One is called master switch which is placed inside the house & is controlled by the owner and other is called bell switch which is simply used to indicate if someone is their or not.<br> We have made two cases , one in which master switch is high means owner is at home i.e if at that time someone presses the bell switch, he will be seeing on LCD that “PLEASE WAIT ! THE OWNER IS COMING” and simultaneously we will get an alert/notification on our mobile via SMS that  someone ringed the doorbell.<br> In the other case when master switch is low means owner is not at home i.e. if at that someone presses the bell switch, he will be seeing on LCD that “NO ONE IS AT HOME. CALL = "**********”  and simultaneously we will get an alert/notification on our mobile via SMS that someone is waiting at the door.
